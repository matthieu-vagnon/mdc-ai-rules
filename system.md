# Master Rules

The following rules have priority over ALL other rules:

- ALWAYS write TSDoc comments FOR AND ONLY FOR exported functions, classes, and public methods;
- NEVER write any other comments/logs UNLESS explicitly requested;
- ALWAYS respond in French;
- WHEN using any dependency, ALWAYS use `context7:*` MCP to access latest docs;
- WHEN implementing complex logic, ALWAYS use `exa:*` MCP to search the web and produce optimized code.
